doubleChocolate:
    title: Double Chocolate Cookies
    logoUrl: assets/doublechocolate.jpg
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Can come with white and/or milk chocolate chips. These cookies have
        chocolate dough and chocolate chips.  
stdChocoChip:
    title: Chocolate chip Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Just like mother used to make. Or rather, a version of what mother
        used to make. Unless you pick a preference, the cookies might have 
        a variation of either milk chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate and 
        white chocolate mix for their chips. Both are awesome enough that 
        the baker can’t pick one to be the standard variation.  
oatmealRaisin:
    title: Oatmeal Raisin Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Also available with cranberry raisin. Very similar to the cookies that
        you can buy at the store, but, again, better.
whiteChocolateCraisin:
    title: White chocolate Craisin Cookies
    logoUrl: assets/whitechocolatecraisin.jpg
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Oatmeal cookies with white chocolate chips and cranberry raisin. It
        might not sound like something you really need to have, but they are.
        Cranberry and white chocolate pair together better than you would ever
        think, and these cookies are proof of it.
shortbread:
    title: Butterscotch Shortbread
    logoUrl: assets/shortbread.jpg
    price: 10
    description: 'Standard butterscotch shortbread. You know what it is, it''s delicious.'
snickerdoodles:
    title: Snickerdoodles

    price: 10
    description: 'Snickerdoodles- like you could buy in the store, only better.'
pinaColada:
    title: Pina Colada Cookies
    logoUrl: assets/pinacolada.jpg
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Soft cookies made with pineapple and coconut. If wanted, the addition of
        mango makes them an instant antidepressant according to one customer.
sugarCookies:
    title: Sugar cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        As a general rule, these are pretty close to generic sugar cookies with
        vanilla flavoring. If asked, they can be rolled out into flat circles
        for decoration but otherwise will just be shaped as gently sloping
        mostly-circles. Unless requested otherwise, will be vanilla flavored. If
        requested, other flavors or colors can be used for variety.
almondJoy:
    title: Almond Joy Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        You like almond joy candy bars? Have almond joy cookies. These are
        chocolate chip cookies with milk chocolate chips, almonds, and coconut.
        They are entirely worth it.
chocolateCoffee:
    title: Chocolate Coffee Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        In case you don’t have any coffee to dip your cookie in, these cookies
        already have coffee flavoring in them. They are chocolate dough with
        coffee flavoring and chocolate chips.
chocolateOrange:
    title: Chocolate Orange Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        For those who love the chocolate oranges for sale every Christmas, these
        are cookies that are chocolate chip with orange flavoring. Your choice
        if the dough is chocolate also.
chocolateMint:
    title: Mint Chocolate Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        For those who love mint chocolate, these cookies are minty with
        chocolate chips and chocolate dough.
chocolateToffee:
    title: Toffee Chocolate Chip Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        These are chocolate chip cookies with toffee chips in them. The dough
        can be chocolate flavored or regular, depending on your preference. Both
        are really good.
butterscotchOatmeal:
    title: Butterscotch Oatmeal
    price: 10
    description: >-
        These are a sweet brown sugar and oatmeal cookie that is highly
        addictive and has probably added 10 pounds to the family of the baker.
coconutSugar:
    title: Coconut Sugar Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        These cookies are incredibly sweet and sugary, made mostly of coconut
        and held together by a soft dough that melts in the mouth. These thin,
        flat, cookies are chewy only because of the masses of coconut in them,
        and are more addictive than most. Even without liking coconut
        particularly, I’ve eaten an entire box without noticing.
biscotti:
    title: Biscotti
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Flavors and prices are negotiable, along with additions like dried fruit, nuts,
        chocolate chips, or anything else. These twice-baked biscuits can
        taste like anything and are easily dipped in chocolate for an
        additional cost, which is very much worth it. Orange flavored biscotti
        with chocolate is a tasty treat, or apple flavored in tea, or even
        plain almond with or without chocolate. If you know what you want
        it to be, I’m willing to try to make it. 
varietyPack:
    title: Random Variety Pack
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Surprise me! This is just a clamshell filled with a random variety of
        whatever the bakers were working on when the order came in. Will
        probably be heavy on one variety or another, but they're all good.
bananaBread:
    title: Banana Bread
    price: 3-8
    description: >-
        This comes in plain or chocolate, with the additional options of
        added walnuts or chocolate chips. As one who grew up on this bread,
        toast a slice with some butter on it and you’ll accidentally eat half
        the loaf. Small loaves are approximately 3x5.5x2 and $3, and large
        loaves are approximately 5x9x3 and $8.
cinnamonRoll:
    title: Cinnamon Roll
    price: $1 for 2, 8"x8" pan for $5
    description: >-
        Home-made from scratch, these yeast-bread rolls have been quite a hit
        several times at church or school events, and they’re an excellent choice
        for breakfast with or without icing. They are not sold with icing due to
        the mess it tends to make. To maintain freshness, the rolls are put into a
        1 gallon Ziploc bag, which holds approximately 1 8x8 pan’s worth of these tasty
        treats. These rolls come in a few varieties—cinnamon with walnuts or raisins, or
        with neither.  The popular ones around my house are the walnuts. 
orangeRoll: 
    title: Orange Roll
    price: $1 for 2, 8"x8" pan for $5
    description: Not quite cinnamon rolls, these orange rolls are similar but have
    orange and coconut in them instead of cinnamon. These rolls are sticky and sweet
    and a big change from the cinnamon ones in taste, but they are still glorious and
    tasty. Like with the cinnamon rolls, these are not sold with icing due to the mess
    it tends to make. To maintain freshness, the rolls are put into a 1 gallon Ziploc 
    bag, which holds approximately 1 8x8 pan’s worth of these tasty treats.
