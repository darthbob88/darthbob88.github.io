doubleChocolate:

    price: 10
    description: >-
        Can come with white and/or milk chocolate chips. These cookies have
        chocolate dough and white chocolate chips.  
stdChocoChip:
    title: Chocolate chip Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Just like mother used to make. Or rather, a version of what mother used
        to make. Unless you pick a preference, the cookies might have a
        variation of either milk chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate and white
        chocolate mix for their chips. Both are awesome enough that the baker
        can’t pick one to be the standard variation.
oatmealRaisin:
    title: Oatmeal Raisin Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Also available with cranberry raisin. Very similar to the cookies that
        you can buy at the store, but, again, better.
whiteChocolateCraisin:
    title: White chocolate Craisin Cookies
    logoUrl: assets/whitechocolatecraisin.jpg
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Oatmeal cookies with white chocolate chips and cranberry raisin. It
        might not sound like something you really need to have, but they are.
        Cranberry and white chocolate pair together better than you would ever
        think, and these cookies are proof of it.

    logoUrl: assets/pinacolada.jpg
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Soft cookies made with pineapple and coconut. If wanted, the addition of
        mango makes them an instant antidepressant according to one customer.
sugarCookies:
    title: Sugar cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-
        As a general rule, these are pretty close to generic sugar cookies with
        vanilla flavoring. If asked, they can be rolled out into flat circles
        for decoration but otherwise will just be shaped as gently sloping
        mostly-circles. Unless requested otherwise, will be vanilla flavored. If
        requested, other flavors or colors can be used for variety.

    title: Almond Joy Cookies
    price: 10
    description: >-

        chocolate chip cookies with milk chocolate chips, almonds, and coconut.
        They are entirely worth it.

        coffee flavoring and chocolate chips.
chocolateOrange:

    price: 10

        For those who love the chocolate oranges for sale every Christmas, these
        are cookies that are chocolate chip with orange flavoring. Your choice
        if the dough is chocolate also.

butterscotchOatmeal:
    title: Butterscotch Oatmeal
    price: 10
    description: >-
        These are a sweet brown sugar and oatmeal cookie that is highly
        addictive and has probably added 10 pounds to the family of the baker.
varietyPack:
    title: Random Variety Pack
    price: 10
    description: >-
        Surprise me! This is just a clamshell filled with a random variety of
        whatever the bakers were working on when the order came in. Will
        probably be heavy on one variety or another, but they're all good.
