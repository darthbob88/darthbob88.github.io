description: >-
  These cookies are handmade in small batches as they are ordered and each batch of cookies can be
  personalized within certain limits if requested. Cookie types will be added to the list available
  as the recipes are created and perfected. The cookie baker has high standards on the flavor of the cookies,
  but doesn’t work as much to make them all standard in looks. If you want a uniform box of cookies, get some Oreos.

clamshellDescription: >-
  Each order of cookies is a clamshell box approximately 7x7x3 inches,
  full of somewhere around 1 ½ to 2 pounds of whichever kind of cookies is ordered,
  weight varying due to the size and texture of the cookies.

whySellByBox: >-
  Cookies are currently sold by the box, rather than by the dozen, for two reasons.
  First, the cookies we make are not consistent in size and therefore filling a box with one type of cookies
  might take 3 dozen of one kind or 4 dozen of another, or it could vary between batches.
  Furthermore, if you want a mixed bag of what we have on hand, then that’s an option that we are willing to give if you
  ask—just give us an outline of what you don’t want or don’t complain if you get nuts when you don’t want them.
